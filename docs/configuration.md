Phantom supports configuration through a `phantom.config.json` file in your repository root. This allows you to define files to be automatically copied and commands to be executed when creating new worktrees. For personal defaults such as `worktreesDirectory`, prefer `phantom preferences` (stored in your global git config); the `worktreesDirectory` key in `phantom.config.json` is deprecated and will be removed in the next version.

## Configuration File

Create a `phantom.config.json` file in your repository root:

```json
{
  "worktreesDirectory": "../phantom-worktrees",
  "postCreate": {
    "copyFiles": [
      ".env",
      ".env.local",
      "config/local.json"
    ],
    "commands": [
      "pnpm install",
      "pnpm build"
    ]
  },
  "preDelete": {
    "commands": [
      "docker compose down"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options

### worktreesDirectory

A custom base directory where Phantom worktrees will be created. By default, Phantom creates all worktrees in `.git/phantom/worktrees/`. Set a per-user location with `phantom preferences set worktreesDirectory <path-from-git-root>` (recommended). The `worktreesDirectory` option in `phantom.config.json` remains temporarily supported for compatibility but is deprecated and will be removed in the next version.

**Use Cases:**
- Store worktrees outside the main repository directory
- Use a shared location for multiple repositories
- Keep worktrees on a different filesystem or drive
- Organize worktrees in a custom directory structure

**Examples:**

**Relative path (relative to repository root):**
```json
{
  "worktreesDirectory": "../phantom-worktrees"
}
```
This creates worktrees directly in `../phantom-worktrees/` (e.g., `../phantom-worktrees/feature-1`)

**Absolute path:**
```json
{
  "worktreesDirectory": "/tmp/my-phantom-worktrees"
}
```
This creates worktrees directly in `/tmp/my-phantom-worktrees/` (e.g., `/tmp/my-phantom-worktrees/feature-1`)

**Directory Structure:**
With `worktreesDirectory` set to `../phantom-worktrees`, your directory structure will look like:

```
parent-directory/
├── your-project/           # Git repository
│   ├── .git/
│   ├── phantom.config.json
│   └── ...
└── phantom-worktrees/      # Custom worktree location
    ├── feature-1/
    ├── feature-2/
    └── bugfix-login/
```

**Notes:**
- If `worktreesDirectory` is not specified, defaults to `.git/phantom/worktrees`
- Use a path relative to the Git repository root (relative paths are resolved from the repo root; absolute paths are used as-is)
- The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
- When worktreesDirectory is specified, worktrees are created directly in that directory
- Prefer configuring this via `phantom preferences set worktreesDirectory <path-from-git-root>`; the `phantom.config.json` key is deprecated and will be removed in the next version

### postCreate.copyFiles

An array of file paths or glob patterns to automatically copy from the current worktree to newly created worktrees.

**Use Cases:**
- Environment configuration files (`.env`, `.env.local`)
- Local development settings across subdirectories
- Secret files that are gitignored
- Database configuration files
- API keys and certificates

**Example:**
```json
{
  "postCreate": {
    "copyFiles": [
      ".env",
      ".env*",
      "config/**/*.local.yml",
      "secrets/[ab]*.json"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Glob Pattern Support:**

Glob patterns allow you to match multiple files with a single pattern. Supported patterns:

- `*` - Matches any characters except `/` (e.g., `*.env` matches `.env` but not `config/.env`)
- `**` - Matches any characters including `/` (recursive, e.g., `**/*.yml` matches all `.yml` files in any subdirectory)
- `?` - Matches any single character (e.g., `file?.txt` matches `file1.txt` but not `file10.txt`)
- `[abc]` - Matches any character in the brackets (e.g., `file-[ab].txt` matches `file-a.txt` and `file-b.txt`)

**Common Patterns:**

- `.env*` - All files starting with `.env` (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, etc.)
- `*.local` - All files ending with `.local` in the root directory
- `config/**/*.local.yml` - All `.local.yml` files anywhere under `config/` directory
- `secrets/[ab]*.json` - All `.json` files in `secrets/` starting with `a` or `b`

**Notes:**
- Paths and patterns are relative to the repository root
- Exact file paths and glob patterns can be mixed in the same array
- Patterns matching no files are silently skipped (no error)
- Directories are excluded from copying (only files are copied)
- Overlapping patterns are automatically deduplicated
- Can be overridden with `--copy-file` command line options

### postCreate.commands

An array of commands to execute after creating a new worktree.

**Use Cases:**
- Installing dependencies
- Building the project
- Setting up the development environment
- Running database migrations
- Generating configuration files

**Example:**
```json
{
  "postCreate": {
    "commands": [
      "pnpm install",
      "pnpm db:migrate",
      "pnpm db:seed"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Commands are executed in order
- Execution stops on the first failed command
- Commands run in the new worktree's directory
- Output is displayed in real-time

### preDelete.commands

An array of commands to execute in a worktree **before** it is deleted. Use this to gracefully shut down resources or clean up artifacts that were created in the worktree.

**Use Cases:**
- Stop background services started from the worktree (e.g., `docker compose down`)
- Remove generated assets or caches before deletion
- Run custom teardown scripts

**Example:**
```json
{
  "preDelete": {
    "commands": [
      "docker compose down"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Commands run in the worktree being deleted
- Commands are executed in order and halt on the first failure
- If a command fails, the worktree is **not** removed
- Output is displayed in real-time
